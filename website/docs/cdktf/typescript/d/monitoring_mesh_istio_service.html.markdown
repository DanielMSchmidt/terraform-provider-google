A Monitoring Service is the root resource under which operational aspects of a
generic service are accessible. A service is some discrete, autonomous, and
network-accessible unit, designed to solve an individual concern

An Mesh Istio monitoring service is automatically created by GCP to monitor
Mesh Istio services.


To get more information about Service, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/ref_v3/rest/v3/services)
* How-to Guides

## Example Usage - Monitoring Mesh Istio Service


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.dataGoogleMonitoringMeshIstioService.DataGoogleMonitoringMeshIstioService(
      this,
      "default",
      {
        meshUid: "proj-573164786102",
        serviceName: "prometheus",
        serviceNamespace: "istio-system",
