# IAM policy for Billing Account

Three different resources help you manage IAM policies on billing accounts. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `googleBillingAccountIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the billing accounts and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* `googleBillingAccountIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the table are preserved.
* `googleBillingAccountIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role of the billing accounts are preserved.

~> **Note:** `googleBillingAccountIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `googleBillingAccountIamBinding` and `googleBillingAccountIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be. In addition, be careful not to accidentally unset ownership of the billing account as `googleBillingAccountIamPolicy` replaces the entire policy.

~> **Note:** `googleBillingAccountIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `googleBillingAccountIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `billingAccountId` - (Required) The billing account id.

For `googleBillingAccountIamMember` or `googleBillingAccountIamBinding`:

* `member/members` - (Required) Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
  Each entry can have one of the following values:
  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
    `googleBillingAccountIamBinding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parentName}/roles/{roleName}`. Read more about roles [here](https://cloud.google.com/bigtable/docs/access-control#roles).

`googleBillingAccountIamPolicy` only:
* `policyData` - (Required) The policy data generated by a `googleIamPolicy` data source.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the billing account's IAM policy.

## Import

Instance IAM resources can be imported using the project, table name, role and/or member.

```
$ terraform import google_billing_account_iam_policy.binding "your-billing-account-id"

$ terraform import google_billing_account_iam_binding.binding "your-billing-account-id roles/billing.user"

$ terraform import google_billing_account_iam_member.binding "your-billing-account-id roles/billing.user user:jane@example.com"
```

-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 full name of the custom role, e.g. `organizations/myOrgId/roles/myCustomRole`.
