# google\_compute\_instance\_from\_machine\_image

Manages a VM instance resource within GCE. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances).

This resource is specifically to create a compute instance from a given
`sourceMachineImage`. To create an instance without a machine image, use the
`googleComputeInstance` resource.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.ComputeInstanceFromMachineImage(this, "tpl", {
      can_ip_forward: false,
      labels: [
        {
          my_key: "my_value",
        },
      ],
      name: "instance-from-machine-image",
      provider: googleBeta,
      source_machine_image: "projects/PROJECT-ID/global/machineImages/NAME",
      zone: "us-central1-a",
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sourceMachineImage` - (Required) Name or self link of a machine
  image to create the instance based on.

- - -

* `zone` - (Optional) The zone that the machine should be created in. If not
  set, the provider zone is used.

In addition to these, most* arguments from `googleComputeInstance` are supported
as a way to override the properties in the machine image. All exported attributes
from `googleComputeInstance` are likewise exported here.

~> **Warning:** *Due to API limitations, disk overrides are currently disabled. This includes the "boot_disk", "attached_disk", and "scratch_disk" fields.

## Attributes Reference

All exported attributes from `googleComputeInstance` are exported here.
