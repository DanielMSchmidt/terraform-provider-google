# google\_storage\_default\_object\_acl

Authoritatively manages the default object ACLs for a Google Cloud Storage bucket
without managing the bucket itself.

-> Note that for each object, its creator will have the `"OWNER"` role in addition
to the default ACL that has been defined.

For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists) 
and 
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/defaultObjectAccessControls).

-> Want fine-grained control over default object ACLs? Use `google_storage_default_object_access_control`
to control individual role entity pairs.

## Example Usage

Example creating a default object ACL on a bucket with one owner, and one reader.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google_storage_bucket_image_store =
        google.storage_bucket.StorageBucket(self, "image-store",
            location="EU",
            name="image-store-bucket"
        )
        google.storage_default_object_acl.StorageDefaultObjectAcl(self, "image-store-default-acl",
            bucket=cdktf.Token.as_string(google_storage_bucket_image_store.name),
            role_entity=["OWNER:user-my.email@gmail.com", "READER:group-mygroup"]
        )
```

## Argument Reference
