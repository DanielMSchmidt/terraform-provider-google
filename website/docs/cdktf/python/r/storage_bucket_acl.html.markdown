# google\_storage\_bucket\_acl

Authoritatively manages a bucket's ACLs in Google cloud storage service (GCS). For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/bucketAccessControls).

Bucket ACLs can be managed non authoritatively using the [`storage_bucket_access_control`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/storage_bucket_access_control) resource. Do not use these two resources in conjunction to manage the same bucket.

Permissions can be granted either by ACLs or Cloud IAM policies. In general, permissions granted by Cloud IAM policies do not appear in ACLs, and permissions granted by ACLs do not appear in Cloud IAM policies. The only exception is for ACLs applied directly on a bucket and certain bucket-level Cloud IAM policies, as described in [Cloud IAM relation to ACLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam#acls).

**NOTE** This resource will not remove the `project-owners-<project_id>` entity from the `OWNER` role.

## Example Usage

Example creating an ACL on a bucket with one owner, and one reader.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google_storage_bucket_image_store =
        google.storage_bucket.StorageBucket(self, "image-store",
            location="EU",
            name="image-store-bucket"
        )
        google.storage_bucket_acl.StorageBucketAcl(self, "image-store-acl",
            bucket=cdktf.Token.as_string(google_storage_bucket_image_store.name),
            role_entity=["OWNER:user-my.email@gmail.com", "READER:group-mygroup"]
        )
```
