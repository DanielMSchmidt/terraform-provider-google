## Example Usage

Example creating a nightly Transfer Job from an AWS S3 Bucket to a GCS bucket.

```hcl
data "google_storage_transfer_project_service_account" "default" {
  project = var.project
}

resource "google_storage_bucket" "s3-backup-bucket" {
  name          = "${var.aws_s3_bucket}-backup"

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `description` - (Required) Unique description to identify the Transfer Job.

* `transferSpec` - (Required) Transfer specification. Structure [documented below](#nested_transfer_spec).

* `schedule` - (Required) Schedule specification defining when the Transfer Job should be scheduled to start, end and what time to run. Structure [documented below](#nested_schedule).

- - -

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it
	is not provided, the provider project is used.

* `status` - (Optional) Status of the job. Default: `enabled`. **NOTE: The effect of the new job status takes place during a subsequent job run. For example, if you change the job status from ENABLED to DISABLED, and an operation spawned by the transfer is running, the status change would not affect the current operation.**

* `notificationConfig` - (Optional) Notification configuration. This is not supported for transfers involving PosixFilesystem. Structure [documented below](#nested_notification_config).

<a name="nested_transfer_spec"></a>The `transferSpec` block supports:

* `sourceAgentPoolName` - (Optional) Specifies the agent pool name associated with the posix data source. When unspecified, the default name is used.

Object conditions based on objects' `lastModificationTime` do not exclude objects in a data sink. Structure [documented below](#nested_object_conditions).

* `transferOptions` - (Optional) Characteristics of how to treat files from datasource and sink during job. If the option `deleteObjectsUniqueInSink` is true, object conditions based on objects' `lastModificationTime` are ignored and do not exclude objects in a data source or a data sink. Structure [documented below](#nested_transfer_options).

* `gcsDataSource` - (Optional) A Google Cloud Storage data source. Structure [documented below](#nested_gcs_data_source).

* `posixDataSource` - (Optional) A POSIX filesystem data source. Structure [documented below](#nested_posix_data_source).

Note that when configuring a transfer with the Cloud Platform Console, the transfer's start time in a day is specified in your local timezone. Structure [documented below](#nested_start_time_of_day).
