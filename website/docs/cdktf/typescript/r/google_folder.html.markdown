# google\_folder

Allows management of a Google Cloud Platform folder. For more information see 
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders)
and 
[API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v2/folders).

A folder can contain projects, other folders, or a combination of both. You can use folders to group projects under an organization in a hierarchy. For example, your organization might contain multiple departments, each with its own set of Cloud Platform resources. Folders allows you to group these resources on a per-department basis. Folders are used to group resources that share common IAM policies.

Folders created live inside an Organization. See the [Organization documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/quickstarts) for more details.

The service account used to run Terraform when creating a `googleFolder`
resource must have `roles/resourcemanagerFolderCreator`. See the
[Access Control for Folders Using IAM](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/access-control-folders)
doc for more information.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleFolderDepartment1 = new google.folder.Folder(
      this,
      "department1",
      {
        displayName: "Department 1",
        parent: "organizations/1234567",
      }
    );
    new google.folder.Folder(this, "team-abc", {
      displayName: "Team ABC",
      parent: cdktf.Token.asString(googleFolderDepartment1.name),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `displayName` - (Required) The folder’s display name.
    A folder’s display name must be unique amongst its siblings, e.g. no two folders with the same parent can share the same display name. The display name must start and end with a letter or digit, may contain letters, digits, spaces, hyphens and underscores and can be no longer than 30 characters. 

* `parent` - (Required) The resource name of the parent Folder or Organization.
    Must be of the form `folders/{folderId}` or `organizations/{orgId}`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `name` - The resource name of the Folder. Its format is folders/{folder_id}.
* `lifecycleState` - The lifecycle state of the folder such as `active` or `deleteRequested`.
* `createTime` - Timestamp when the Folder was created. Assigned by the server.
    A timestamp in RFC3339 UTC "Zulu" format, accurate to nanoseconds. Example: "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z".

## Import

Folders can be imported using the folder's id, e.g.

```
# Both syntaxes are valid
$ terraform import google_folder.department1 1234567
$ terraform import google_folder.department1 folders/1234567
```
