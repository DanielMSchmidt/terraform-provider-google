# IAM policy for Spanner databases

Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for a Spanner database. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `google_spanner_database_iam_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the database and replaces any existing policy already attached.

~> **Warning:** It's entirely possibly to lock yourself out of your database using `google_spanner_database_iam_policy`. Any permissions granted by default will be removed unless you include them in your config.

* `google_spanner_database_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the database are preserved.
* `google_spanner_database_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the database are preserved.

~> **Note:** `google_spanner_database_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `google_spanner_database_iam_binding` and `google_spanner_database_iam_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

~> **Note:** `google_spanner_database_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_spanner_database_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

## google\_spanner\_database\_iam\_policy

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google

    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)

                members=["user:jane@example.com"],
                role="roles/editor"
            )

        )
```

## google\_spanner\_database\_iam\_binding

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):

            members=["user:jane@example.com"],
            role="roles/compute.networkUser"
        )
```

## google\_spanner\_database\_iam\_member

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):

        google.spanner_database_iam_member.SpannerDatabaseIamMember(self, "database",
            database="your-database-name",
            instance="your-instance-name",
            member="user:jane@example.com",
            role="roles/compute.networkUser"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `database` - (Required) The name of the Spanner database.

* `instance` - (Required) The name of the Spanner instance the database belongs to.

* `member/members` - (Required) Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
  Each entry can have one of the following values:
  * **allUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account.
  * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.
  * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com.
  * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com.
  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
    `google_spanner_database_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.

* `policy_data` - (Required only by `google_spanner_database_iam_policy`) The policy data generated by
  a `google_iam_policy` data source.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the database's IAM policy.

## Import

For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms:

* {{project}}/{{instance}}/{{database}}
* {{instance}}/{{database}} (project is taken from provider project)

IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_spanner_database_iam_member.database "project-name/instance-name/database-name roles/viewer user:foo@example.com"
```

IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiers; the resource in question and the role, e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_spanner_database_iam_binding.database "project-name/instance-name/database-name roles/viewer"
```

IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_spanner_database_iam_policy.database project-name/instance-name/database-name
```

-> **Custom Roles:** If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
