# google\_project\_iam\_custom\_role

Allows management of a customized Cloud IAM project role. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-custom-roles)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/projects.roles).

~> **Warning:** Note that custom roles in GCP have the concept of a soft-delete. There are two issues that may arise
 from this and how roles are propagated. 1) creating a role may involve undeleting and then updating a role with the
 same name, possibly causing confusing behavior between undelete and update. 2) A deleted role is permanently deleted
 after 7 days, but it can take up to 30 more days (i.e. between 7 and 37 days after deletion) before the role name is
 made available again. This means a deleted role that has been deleted for more than 7 days cannot be changed at all
 by Terraform, and new roles cannot share that name.

## Example Usage

This snippet creates a customized IAM role.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google.project_iam_custom_role.ProjectIamCustomRole(self, "my-custom-role",
            description="A description",
            permissions=["iam.roles.list", "iam.roles.create", "iam.roles.delete"],
            role_id="myCustomRole",
            title="My Custom Role"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `role_id` - (Required) The camel case role id to use for this role. Cannot contain `-` characters.

* `title` - (Required) A human-readable title for the role.

* `permissions` (Required) The names of the permissions this role grants when bound in an IAM policy. At least one permission must be specified.

* `project` - (Optional) The project that the service account will be created in.
    Defaults to the provider project configuration.

* `stage` - (Optional) The current launch stage of the role.
    Defaults to `GA`.
    List of possible stages is [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/reference/rest/v1/organizations.roles#Role.RoleLaunchStage).

* `description` - (Optional) A human-readable description for the role.

## Attributes Reference

 In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

 * `deleted` - (Optional) The current deleted state of the role.

 * `id` - an identifier for the resource with the format `projects/{{project}}/roles/{{role_id}}`

 * `name` - The name of the role in the format `projects/{{project}}/roles/{{role_id}}`. Like `id`, this field can be used as a reference in other resources such as IAM role bindings.

## Import


Custom Roles can be imported using any of these accepted formats:

```
$ terraform import google_project_iam_custom_role.default projects/{{project}}/roles/{{role_id}}
$ terraform import google_project_iam_custom_role.default {{project}}/{{role_id}}
$ terraform import google_project_iam_custom_role.default {{role_id}}
```
