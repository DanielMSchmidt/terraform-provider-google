# IAM policy for Pubsub Subscription

Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for pubsub subscription. Each of these resources serves a different use case:

* `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the subscription and replaces any existing policy already attached.
* `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the subscription are preserved.
* `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_member`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the subscription are preserved.

~> **Note:** `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding` and `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.

~> **Note:** `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_member` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `subscription` - (Required) The subscription name or id to bind to attach IAM policy to.

* `member/members` - (Required) Identities that will be granted the privilege in `role`.
  Each entry can have one of the following values:

  * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.
  * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com.

  * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com.

* `role` - (Required) The role that should be applied. Only one
    `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format
    `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`.

* `policy_data` - (Required only by `google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy`) The policy data generated by
  a `google_iam_policy` data source.

- - -

* `project` - (Optional) The project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `etag` - (Computed) The etag of the subscription's IAM policy.

## Import

Pubsub subscription IAM resources can be imported using the project, subscription name, role and member.

```
$ terraform import google_pubsub_subscription_iam_policy.editor projects/{your-project-id}/subscriptions/{your-subscription-name}

$ terraform import google_pubsub_subscription_iam_binding.editor "projects/{your-project-id}/subscriptions/{your-subscription-name} roles/editor"

$ terraform import google_pubsub_subscription_iam_member.editor "projects/{your-project-id}/subscriptions/{your-subscription-name} roles/editor jane@example.com"
```

-> **Custom Roles**: If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
