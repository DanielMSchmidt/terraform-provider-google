# google\_monitoring\_uptime\_check\_ips

Returns the list of IP addresses that checkers run from. For more information see
the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks#get-ips).

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_google_monitoring_uptime_check_ips_ips =
        google.data_google_monitoring_uptime_check_ips.DataGoogleMonitoringUptimeCheckIps(self, "ips")
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "ip_list",
            value=data_google_monitoring_uptime_check_ips_ips.uptime_check_ips
        )
```

## Attributes Reference

The following computed attributes are exported:

* `uptime_check_ips` - A list of uptime check IPs used by Stackdriver Monitoring. Each `uptime_check_ip` contains:
  * `region` - A broad region category in which the IP address is located.
  * `location` - A more specific location within the region that typically encodes a particular city/town/metro
  (and its containing state/province or country) within the broader umbrella region category.
  * `ip_address` - The IP address from which the Uptime check originates. This is a fully specified IP address
  (not an IP address range). Most IP addresses, as of this publication, are in IPv4 format; however, one should not
  rely on the IP addresses being in IPv4 format indefinitely, and should support interpreting this field in either
  IPv4 or IPv6 format.
