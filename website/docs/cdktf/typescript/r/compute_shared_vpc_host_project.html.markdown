Enables the Google Compute Engine

feature for a project, assigning it as a Shared VPC host project.

For more information, see,
[the Project API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/projects),
where the Shared VPC feature is referred to by its former name "XPN".

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleComputeSharedVpcHostProjectHost =
      new google.computeSharedVpcHostProject.ComputeSharedVpcHostProject(
        this,
        "host",
        {
          project: "host-project-id",
        }
      );
    new google.computeSharedVpcServiceProject.ComputeSharedVpcServiceProject(
      this,
      "service1",
      {
        hostProject: cdktf.Token.asString(
          googleComputeSharedVpcHostProjectHost.project
        ),
        serviceProject: "service-project-id-1",
      }
    );
    new google.computeSharedVpcServiceProject.ComputeSharedVpcServiceProject(
      this,
      "service2",
      {
        hostProject: cdktf.Token.asString(
          googleComputeSharedVpcHostProjectHost.project
        ),
        serviceProject: "service-project-id-2",
      }
    );
  }
}

```
