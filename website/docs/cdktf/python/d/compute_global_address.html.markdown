import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google_dns_managed_zone_prod = google.dns_managed_zone.DnsManagedZone(self, "prod",
            dns_name="prod.mydomain.com.",
            name="prod-zone"
        )
        data_google_compute_global_address_my_address =
        google.data_google_compute_global_address.DataGoogleComputeGlobalAddress(self, "my_address",
            name="foobar"
        )
        google.dns_record_set.DnsRecordSet(self, "frontend",
            managed_zone=cdktf.Token.as_string(google_dns_managed_zone_prod.name),
            name="lb.${" + google_dns_managed_zone_prod.dns_name + "}",
            rrdatas=[
