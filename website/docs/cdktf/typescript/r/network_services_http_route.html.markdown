# google\_network\_services\_http\_route

HttpRoute is the resource defining how HTTP traffic should be routed by a Mesh or Gateway resource.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about HttpRoute, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/traffic-director/docs/reference/network-services/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.httpRoutes)
* How-to Guides
    * [Setup HTTP Services](https://cloud.google.com/traffic-director/docs/set-up-envoy-http-mesh)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `hostnames` -
  (Required)
  Set of hosts that should match against the HTTP host header to select a HttpRoute to process the request.

* `rules` -
  (Required)
  Rules that define how traffic is routed and handled.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_rules).

* `name` -
  (Required)
  Name of the HttpRoute resource.


<a name="nested_rules"></a>The `rules` block supports:

* `matches` -
  (Optional)
  A list of matches define conditions used for matching the rule against incoming HTTP requests. Each match is independent, i.e. this rule will be matched if ANY one of the matches is satisfied.
  If no matches field is specified, this rule will unconditionally match traffic.
  If a default rule is desired to be configured, add a rule with no matches specified to the end of the rules list.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_matches).

* `action` -
  (Optional)
  The detailed rule defining how to route matched traffic.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_action).


<a name="nested_matches"></a>The `matches` block supports:

* `ignoreCase` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies if prefixMatch and fullPathMatch matches are case sensitive. The default value is false.

* `fullPathMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The HTTP request path value should exactly match this value.

* `prefixMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The HTTP request path value must begin with specified prefixMatch. prefixMatch must begin with a /.

* `regexMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The HTTP request path value must satisfy the regular expression specified by regexMatch after removing any query parameters and anchor supplied with the original URL. For regular expression grammar, please see https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax

* `queryParameters` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a list of query parameters to match against.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_query_parameters).

* `headers` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a list of HTTP request headers to match against.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_headers).


<a name="nested_query_parameters"></a>The `queryParameters` block supports:

* `queryParameter` -
  (Optional)
  The name of the query parameter to match.

* `exactMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the query parameter must exactly match the contents of exactMatch.

* `regexMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the query parameter must match the regular expression specified by regexMatch.For regular expression grammar, please see https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax

* `presentMatch` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies that the QueryParameterMatcher matches if request contains query parameter, irrespective of whether the parameter has a value or not.

<a name="nested_headers"></a>The `headers` block supports:

* `header` -
  (Optional)
  The name of the HTTP header to match against.

* `invertMatch` -
  (Optional)
  If specified, the match result will be inverted before checking. Default value is set to false.

* `exactMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the header should match exactly the content of exactMatch.

* `regexMatch` -
  (Optional)
  The value of the header must match the regular expression specified in regexMatch.

* `prefixMatch` -
  (Optional)
