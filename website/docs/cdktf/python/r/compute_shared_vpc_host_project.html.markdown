# google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project

Enables the Google Compute Engine
[Shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/shared-vpc)
feature for a project, assigning it as a Shared VPC host project.

For more information, see,
[the Project API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/projects),
where the Shared VPC feature is referred to by its former name "XPN".

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project_host =
        google.compute_shared_vpc_host_project.ComputeSharedVpcHostProject(self, "host",
            project="host-project-id"
        )
        google.compute_shared_vpc_service_project.ComputeSharedVpcServiceProject(self, "service1",
            host_project=cdktf.Token.as_string(google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project_host.project),
            service_project="service-project-id-1"
        )
        google.compute_shared_vpc_service_project.ComputeSharedVpcServiceProject(self, "service2",
            host_project=cdktf.Token.as_string(google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project_host.project),
            service_project="service-project-id-2"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are expected:

* `project` - (Required) The ID of the project that will serve as a Shared VPC host project

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{project}}`

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options: configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 4 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 4 minutes.

## Import

Google Compute Engine Shared VPC host project feature can be imported using the `project`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import google_compute_shared_vpc_host_project.host host-project-id
```
