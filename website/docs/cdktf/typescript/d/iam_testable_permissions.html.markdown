Retrieve a list of testable permissions for a resource. Testable permissions mean the permissions that user can add or remove in a role at a given resource. The resource can be referenced either via the full resource name or via a URI.

## Example Usage

Retrieve all the supported permissions able to be set on `myProject` that are in either GA or BETA. This is useful for dynamically constructing custom roles.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.dataGoogleIamTestablePermissions.DataGoogleIamTestablePermissions(
      this,
      "perms",
      {
        fullResourceName:
          "//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/my-project",
        stages: ["GA", "BETA"],
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `fullResourceName` - (Required) See [full resource name documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name) for more detail.
* `stages` - (Optional) The acceptable release stages of the permission in the output. Note that `beta` does not include permissions in `ga`, but you can specify both with `["GA", "BETA"]` for example. Can be a list of `"alpha"`, `"beta"`, `"ga"`, `"deprecated"`. Default is `["ga"]`.
* `customSupportLevel` - (Optional) The level of support for custom roles. Can be one of `"notSupported"`, `"supported"`, `"testing"`. Default is `"supported"`

## Attributes Reference
