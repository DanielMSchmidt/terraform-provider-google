# google\_data\_loss\_prevention\_stored\_info\_type

Allows creation of custom info types.


To get more information about StoredInfoType, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.storedInfoTypes)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/creating-stored-infotypes)

## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Basic


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.dataLossPreventionStoredInfoType.DataLossPreventionStoredInfoType(
      this,
      "basic",
      {
        description: "Description",
        displayName: "Displayname",
        parent: "projects/my-project-name",
        regex: {
          groupIndexes: [2],
          pattern: "patient",
        },
      }
    );
  }
}

```
## Example Usage - Dlp Stored Info Type Dictionary


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.dataLossPreventionStoredInfoType.DataLossPreventionStoredInfoType(
      this,
      "dictionary",
      {
        description: "Description",
        dictionary: {
          wordList: {
            words: ["word", "word2"],
          },
        },
        displayName: "Displayname",
        parent: "projects/my-project-name",
      }
    );
  }
}

      new google.storageBucketObject.StorageBucketObject(this, "object", {
        bucket: cdktf.Token.asString(googleStorageBucketBucket.name),
        name: "tf-test-object",
        source: "./test-fixtures/dlp/words.txt",
      });
