# google\_compute\_instance\_from\_machine\_image

Manages a VM instance resource within GCE. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/instances).

This resource is specifically to create a compute instance from a given
`source_machine_image`. To create an instance without a machine image, use the
`google_compute_instance` resource.


## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google.ComputeInstanceFromMachineImage(self, "tpl",
            can_ip_forward=False,
            labels=[{
                "my_key": "my_value"
            }
            ],
            name="instance-from-machine-image",
            provider=google_beta,
            source_machine_image="projects/PROJECT-ID/global/machineImages/NAME",
            zone="us-central1-a"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource, required by GCE.
    Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_machine_image` - (Required) Name or self link of a machine
  image to create the instance based on.

- - -

* `zone` - (Optional) The zone that the machine should be created in. If not
  set, the provider zone is used.

In addition to these, most* arguments from `google_compute_instance` are supported
as a way to override the properties in the machine image. All exported attributes
from `google_compute_instance` are likewise exported here.

~> **Warning:** *Due to API limitations, disk overrides are currently disabled. This includes the "boot_disk", "attached_disk", and "scratch_disk" fields.

## Attributes Reference

All exported attributes from `google_compute_instance` are exported here.

for details.
