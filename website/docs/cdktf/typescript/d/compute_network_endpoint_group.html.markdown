# google\_compute\_network\_endpoint\_group

Use this data source to access a Network Endpoint Group's attributes.

The NEG may be found by providing either a `selfLink`, or a `name` and a `zone`.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.dataGoogleComputeNetworkEndpointGroup.DataGoogleComputeNetworkEndpointGroup(
      this,
      "neg1",
      {
        name: "k8s1-abcdef01-myns-mysvc-8080-4b6bac43",
        zone: "us-central1-a",
      }
    );
    new google.dataGoogleComputeNetworkEndpointGroup.DataGoogleComputeNetworkEndpointGroup(
      this,
      "neg2",
      {
        selfLink:
          "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/myproject/zones/us-central1-a/networkEndpointGroups/k8s1-abcdef01-myns-mysvc-8080-4b6bac43",
      }
    );
  }
}

```
