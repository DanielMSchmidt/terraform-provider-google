# google\_firebase\_hosting\_channel

A `channel` represents a stream of releases for a site. All sites have a default
`live` channel that serves content to the Firebase-provided subdomains and any
connected custom domains.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about Channel, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/sites.channels)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Basic


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault = new google.FirebaseHostingSite(
      this,
      "default",
      {
        project: "my-project-name",
        provider: googleBeta,
        site_id: "site-with-channel",
      }
    );
    const googleFirebaseHostingChannelDefault =
      new google.FirebaseHostingChannel(this, "default_1", {
        channel_id: "channel-basic",
        provider: googleBeta,
        site_id: googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault.siteId,
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    googleFirebaseHostingChannelDefault.overrideLogicalId("default");
  }
}

```
## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Full


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault = new google.FirebaseHostingSite(
      this,
      "default",
      {
        project: "my-project-name",
        provider: googleBeta,
        site_id: "site-with-channel",
      }
    );
    new google.FirebaseHostingChannel(this, "full", {
      channel_id: "channel-full",
      labels: [
        {
          "some-key": "some-value",
        },
      ],
      provider: googleBeta,
      retained_release_count: 20,
      site_id: googleFirebaseHostingSiteDefault.siteId,
      ttl: "86400s",
    });
  }
}

```
