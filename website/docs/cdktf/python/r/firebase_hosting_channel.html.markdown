# google\_firebase\_hosting\_channel

A `Channel` represents a stream of releases for a site. All sites have a default
`live` channel that serves content to the Firebase-provided subdomains and any
connected custom domains.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about Channel, see:

* [API documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/hosting/rest/v1beta1/sites.channels)
* How-to Guides
    * [Official Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)

## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Basic


```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google_firebase_hosting_site_default = google.FirebaseHostingSite(self, "default",
            project="my-project-name",
            provider=google_beta,
            site_id="site-with-channel"
        )
        google_firebase_hosting_channel_default =
        google.FirebaseHostingChannel(self, "default_1",
            channel_id="channel-basic",
            provider=google_beta,
            site_id=google_firebase_hosting_site_default.site_id
        )
        # This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.
        google_firebase_hosting_channel_default.override_logical_id("default")
```
## Example Usage - Firebasehosting Channel Full


```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google_firebase_hosting_site_default = google.FirebaseHostingSite(self, "default",
            project="my-project-name",
            provider=google_beta,
            site_id="site-with-channel"
        )
        google.FirebaseHostingChannel(self, "full",
            channel_id="channel-full",
            labels=[{
                "some-key": "some-value"
            }
            ],
            provider=google_beta,
            retained_release_count=20,
            site_id=google_firebase_hosting_site_default.site_id,
            ttl="86400s"
        )
