# google\_secret\_manager\_secret\_version

Get the value and metadata from a Secret Manager secret version. For more information see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/) and [API](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.secrets.versions). If you don't need the metadata (i.e., if you want to use a more limited role to access the secret version only), see also the [google_secret_manager_secret_version_access](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/data-sources/secret_manager_secret_version_access) datasource.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google.data_google_secret_manager_secret_version.DataGoogleSecretManagerSecretVersion(self, "basic",
            secret="my-secret"
        )
```
