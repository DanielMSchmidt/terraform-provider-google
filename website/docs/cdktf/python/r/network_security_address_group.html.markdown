AddressGroup is a resource that specifies how a collection of IP/DNS used in Firewall Policy.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about AddressGroup, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/traffic-director/docs/reference/network-security/rest/v1beta1/organizations.locations.addressGroups)
* How-to Guides
    * [Use AddressGroups](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/use-address-groups-firewall-policies)

## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Basic


```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google.NetworkSecurityAddressGroup(self, "default",
            capacity="100",
            items=["208.80.154.224/32"],
            location="us-central1",
            name="my-address-groups",
            parent="projects/my-project-name",
            provider=google_beta,
            type="IPV4"
        )
```
## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Organization Basic


```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        google.NetworkSecurityAddressGroup(self, "default",
            capacity="100",
            items=["208.80.154.224/32"],
            location="us-central1",
