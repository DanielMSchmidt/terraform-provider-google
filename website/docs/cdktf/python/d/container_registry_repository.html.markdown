<!-- Please do not edit this file, it is generated. -->
# google\_container\_registry\_repository

This data source fetches the project name, and provides the appropriate URLs to use for container registry for this project.

The URLs are computed entirely offline - as long as the project exists, they will be valid, but this data source does not contact Google Container Registry (GCR) at any point.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_google_container_registry_repository_foo =
        google.data_google_container_registry_repository.DataGoogleContainerRegistryRepository(self, "foo")
        cdktf.TerraformOutput(self, "gcr_location",
            value=data_google_container_registry_repository_foo.repository_url
        )
```

## Argument Reference
* `project`: (Optional) The project ID that this repository is attached to.  If not provided, provider project will be used instead.
* `region`: (Optional) The GCR region to use.  As of this writing, one of `asia`, `eu`, and `us`.  See [the documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling) for additional information.

## Attributes Reference
In addition to the arguments listed above, this data source exports:

* `repository_url`: The URL at which the repository can be accessed.
