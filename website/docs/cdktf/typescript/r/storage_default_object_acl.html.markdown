# google\_storage\_default\_object\_acl

Authoritatively manages the default object ACLs for a Google Cloud Storage bucket
without managing the bucket itself.

-> Note that for each object, its creator will have the `"owner"` role in addition
to the default ACL that has been defined.

For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists) 
and 
[API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/defaultObjectAccessControls).

-> Want fine-grained control over default object ACLs? Use `googleStorageDefaultObjectAccessControl`
to control individual role entity pairs.

## Example Usage

Example creating a default object ACL on a bucket with one owner, and one reader.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleStorageBucketImageStore =
      new google.storageBucket.StorageBucket(this, "image-store", {
        location: "EU",
        name: "image-store-bucket",
      });
    new google.storageDefaultObjectAcl.StorageDefaultObjectAcl(
      this,
      "image-store-default-acl",
      {
        bucket: cdktf.Token.asString(googleStorageBucketImageStore.name),
        roleEntity: ["OWNER:user-my.email@gmail.com", "READER:group-mygroup"],
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket it applies to.

---

* `roleEntity` - (Optional) List of role/entity pairs in the form `role:entity`.
See [GCS Object ACL documentation](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objectAccessControls) for more details.
Omitting the field is the same as providing an empty list.
