# google_endpoints_service

This resource creates and rolls out a Cloud Endpoints service using OpenAPI or gRPC.  View the relevant docs for [OpenAPI](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/) and [gRPC](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/grpc/).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "google_endpoints_service" "openapi_service" {
  service_name   = "api-name.endpoints.project-id.cloud.goog"
  project        = "project-id"
  openapi_config = file("openapi_spec.yml")
}

resource "google_endpoints_service" "grpc_service" {
  service_name         = "api-name.endpoints.project-id.cloud.goog"
  project              = "project-id"
  grpc_config          = file("service_spec.yml")
  protoc_output_base64 = filebase64("compiled_descriptor_file.pb")
}
```

The example in `examples/endpointsOnComputeEngine` shows the API from the quickstart running on a Compute Engine VM and reachable through Cloud Endpoints, which may also be useful.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `serviceName`: (Required) The name of the service.  Usually of the form `$apinameEndpoints.$projectidCloudGoog`.

- - -

* `openapiConfig`: (Optional) The full text of the OpenAPI YAML configuration as described [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/2.0.md).
Either this, or *both* of `grpcConfig` and `protocOutputBase64` must be specified.

* `grpcConfig`: (Optional) The full text of the Service Config YAML file (Example located [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/main/endpoints/bookstore-grpc/api_config.yaml)).
 If provided, must also provide `protocOutputBase64`.  `openApi` config must *not* be provided.
 
* `protocOutputBase64`: (Optional) The full contents of the Service Descriptor File generated by protoc.  This should be a compiled .pb file, base64-encoded.

* `project`: (Optional) The project ID that the service belongs to.  If not provided, provider project is used.

## Attributes Reference
In addition to the arguments, the following attributes are available:

* `configId`: The autogenerated ID for the configuration that is rolled out as part of the creation of this resource.  Must be provided to compute engine instances as a tag.

* `dnsAddress`: The address at which the service can be found - usually the same as the service name.

* `apis`: A list of API objects; structure is documented below.

* `endpoints`: A list of Endpoint objects; structure is documented below.

* `syntax`: `syntaxProto2` or `syntaxProto3`.
* `version`: A version string for this api. If specified, will have the form major-version.minor-version, e.g. `110`.
* `methods`: A list of Method objects; structure is documented below.

### Method Object Structure
* `name`: The simple name of this method as described in the provided config.
* `syntax`: `syntaxProto2` or `syntaxProto3`.
