# google\_network\_security\_address\_group

AddressGroup is a resource that specifies how a collection of IP/DNS used in Firewall Policy.

~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.

To get more information about AddressGroup, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/traffic-director/docs/reference/network-security/rest/v1beta1/organizations.locations.addressGroups)
* How-to Guides
    * [Use AddressGroups](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/use-address-groups-firewall-policies)

## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Basic


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.NetworkSecurityAddressGroup(this, "default", {
      capacity: "100",
      items: ["208.80.154.224/32"],
      location: "us-central1",
      name: "my-address-groups",
      parent: "projects/my-project-name",
      provider: googleBeta,
      type: "IPV4",
    });
  }
}

```
## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Organization Basic


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.NetworkSecurityAddressGroup(this, "default", {
      capacity: "100",
      items: ["208.80.154.224/32"],
      location: "us-central1",
      name: "my-address-groups",
      parent: "organizations/123456789",
      provider: googleBeta,
      type: "IPV4",
    });
  }
}

```
## Example Usage - Network Security Address Groups Advanced


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.NetworkSecurityAddressGroup(this, "default", {
      capacity: "100",
      description: "my description",
      items: ["208.80.154.224/32"],
      location: "us-central1",
      name: "my-address-groups",
      parent: "projects/my-project-name",
      provider: googleBeta,
      type: "IPV4",
    });
  }
}

```
