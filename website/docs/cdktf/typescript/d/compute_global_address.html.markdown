import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleDnsManagedZoneProd = new google.dnsManagedZone.DnsManagedZone(
      this,
      "prod",
      {
        dnsName: "prod.mydomain.com.",
        name: "prod-zone",
      }
    );
    const dataGoogleComputeGlobalAddressMyAddress =
      new google.dataGoogleComputeGlobalAddress.DataGoogleComputeGlobalAddress(
        this,
        "my_address",
        {
          name: "foobar",
        }
      );
    new google.dnsRecordSet.DnsRecordSet(this, "frontend", {
