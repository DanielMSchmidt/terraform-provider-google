class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_google_compute_backend_service_baz =
        google.data_google_compute_backend_service.DataGoogleComputeBackendService(self, "baz",
            name="foobar"
        )
        google.compute_backend_service.ComputeBackendService(self, "default",
            health_checks=[
                cdktf.Token.as_string(
                    cdktf.property_access(
                        cdktf.Fn.tolist(data_google_compute_backend_service_baz.health_checks), ["0"]))
            ],
            name="backend-service"
