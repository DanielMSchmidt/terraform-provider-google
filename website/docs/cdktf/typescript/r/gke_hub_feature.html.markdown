~> **Warning:** This resource is in beta, and should be used with the terraform-provider-google-beta provider.
See [Provider Versions](https://terraform.io/docs/providers/google/guides/provider_versions.html) for more details on beta resources.


## Example Usage - Multi Cluster Ingress

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleContainerClusterCluster =
      new google.containerCluster.ContainerCluster(this, "cluster", {
        initialNodeCount: 1,
        location: "us-central1-a",
        name: "my-cluster",
        provider: googleBeta,
      });
    const googleGkeHubMembershipMembership = new google.GkeHubMembership(
      this,
      "membership",
      {
        description: "Membership",
        endpoint: [
          {
            gke_cluster: [
              {
                resource_link:
                  "//container.googleapis.com/${" +
                  googleContainerClusterCluster.id +
                  "}",
              },
            ],
          },

      location: "global",
      name: "multiclusteringress",
      provider: googleBeta,
      spec: [
        {
          multiclusteringress: [
            {
              config_membership: googleGkeHubMembershipMembership.id,
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    });
  }
}
