# google\_kms\_secret\_ciphertext

Encrypts secret data with Google Cloud KMS and provides access to the ciphertext.


~> **NOTE:** Using this resource will allow you to conceal secret data within your
resource definitions, but it does not take care of protecting that data in the
logging output, plan output, or state output.  Please take care to secure your secret
data outside of resource definitions.


To get more information about SecretCiphertext, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys/encrypt)
* How-to Guides
    * [Encrypting and decrypting data with a symmetric key](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/encrypt-decrypt)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `plaintext`, `additionalAuthenticatedData`.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Kms Secret Ciphertext Basic


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleKmsKeyRingKeyring = new google.kmsKeyRing.KmsKeyRing(
      this,
      "keyring",
      {
        location: "global",
        name: "keyring-example",
      }
    );
    const googleKmsCryptoKeyCryptokey = new google.kmsCryptoKey.KmsCryptoKey(
      this,
      "cryptokey",
      {
        keyRing: cdktf.Token.asString(googleKmsKeyRingKeyring.id),
        lifecycle: {
          preventDestroy: true,
        },
        name: "crypto-key-example",
        rotationPeriod: "100000s",
      }
    );
    const googleKmsSecretCiphertextMyPassword =
      new google.kmsSecretCiphertext.KmsSecretCiphertext(this, "my_password", {
        cryptoKey: cdktf.Token.asString(googleKmsCryptoKeyCryptokey.id),
        plaintext: "my-secret-password",
      });
    new google.computeInstance.ComputeInstance(this, "instance", {
      bootDisk: {
        initializeParams: {
          image: "debian-cloud/debian-11",
        },
      },
      machineType: "e2-medium",
      metadata: {
        password: cdktf.Token.asString(
          googleKmsSecretCiphertextMyPassword.ciphertext
        ),
      },
      name: "my-instance",
      networkInterface: [
        {
          accessConfig: [{}],
          network: "default",
        },
      ],
      zone: "us-central1-a",
    });
  }
}

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `plaintext` -
  (Required)
  The plaintext to be encrypted.
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `cryptoKey` -
  (Required)
  The full name of the CryptoKey that will be used to encrypt the provided plaintext.
  Format: `'projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/keyRings/{{keyRing}}/cryptoKeys/{{cryptoKey}}'`


- - -


* `additionalAuthenticatedData` -
  (Optional)
  The additional authenticated data used for integrity checks during encryption and decryption.
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - an identifier for the resource with format `{{cryptoKey}}/{{ciphertext}}`

* `ciphertext` -
  Contains the result of encrypting the provided plaintext, encoded in base64.
