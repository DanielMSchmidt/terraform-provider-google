# Using GKE with Terraform

-> Visit the [Provision a GKE Cluster (Google Cloud)](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/gke?in=terraform/kubernetes&utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS) tutorial to learn how to provision and interact
with a GKE cluster.

This page is a brief overview of GKE usage with Terraform, based on the content
available in the [How-to guides for GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to).
It's intended as a supplement for intermediate users, covering cases that are
unintuitive or confusing when using Terraform instead of `gcloud`/the Cloud
Console.

Additionally, you may consider using Google's [`kubernetesEngine`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google)
module, which implements many of these practices for you.

If the information on this page conflicts with recommendations available on
`cloudGoogleCom`, `cloudGoogleCom` should be considered the correct source.

## Interacting with Kubernetes

After creating a `googleContainerCluster` with Terraform, you can use `gcloud` to
configure cluster access, [generating a `kubeconfig` entry](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl#generate_kubeconfig_entry):

```bash
gcloud container clusters get-credentials cluster-name
```

Using this command, `gcloud` will generate a `kubeconfig` entry that uses
`gcloud` as an authentication mechanism. However, sometimes performing
authentication inline with Terraform or a static config without `gcloud` is more
desirable.

### Using the Kubernetes and Helm Providers

When using the `kubernetes` and `helm` providers,
[statically defined credentials](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs#credentials-config)
can allow you to connect to clusters defined in the same config or in a remote
state. You can configure either using configuration such as the following:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as kubernetes from "./.gen/providers/kubernetes";
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    /*The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: kubernetes.
    For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.*/
    const dataGoogleClientConfigProvider =
      new google.dataGoogleClientConfig.DataGoogleClientConfig(
        this,
        "provider",
        {}
      );
    const dataGoogleContainerClusterMyCluster =
      new google.dataGoogleContainerCluster.DataGoogleContainerCluster(
        this,
        "my_cluster",
        {
          location: "us-central1",
          name: "my-cluster",
        }
      );
    new kubernetes.provider.KubernetesProvider(this, "kubernetes", {
      cluster_ca_certificate: cdktf.Fn.base64decode(
        cdktf.Token.asString(
          cdktf.propertyAccess(dataGoogleContainerClusterMyCluster.masterAuth, [
            "0",
            "cluster_ca_certificate",
          ])
        )
      ),
      host: "https://${" + dataGoogleContainerClusterMyCluster.endpoint + "}",
      token: dataGoogleClientConfigProvider.accessToken,
    });
  }
}

```

Alternatively, you can authenticate as another service account on which your
Terraform user has been granted the `roles/iamServiceAccountTokenCreator`
role:

```hcl
data "google_service_account_access_token" "my_kubernetes_sa" {
  target_service_account = "{{service_account}}"
  scopes                 = ["userinfo-email", "cloud-platform"]
  lifetime               = "3600s"
}

data "google_container_cluster" "my_cluster" {
  name     = "my-cluster"
  location = "us-central1"
}

provider "kubernetes" {
  host  = "https://${data.google_container_cluster.my_cluster.endpoint}"
  token = data.google_service_account_access_token.my_kubernetes_sa.access_token
  cluster_ca_certificate = base64decode(
    data.google_container_cluster.my_cluster.master_auth[0].cluster_ca_certificate,
  )
}
```

### Using kubectl / kubeconfig

It's possible to interface with `kubectl` or other `kubeconfig`-based tools by
providing them a `kubeconfig` directly. For situations where `gcloud` can't be
used as an authentication mechanism, you can generate a static `kubeconfig`
file instead.

An authentication submodule, `auth`, is provided as part of Google's
[`kubernetesEngine`](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/kubernetes-engine/google)
module. You can use it through the module registry, or [in the module source](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/tree/master/modules/auth).

Authenticating using this method will use a Terraform-generated access token
which persists for 1 hour. For longer-lasting sessions, or cases where a single
persistent config is required, using `gcloud` is advised.

## VPC-native Clusters

[VPC-native clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips)
are GKE clusters that use [alias IP ranges](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/alias-ip).
VPC-native clusters route traffic between pods using a VPC network, and are able
to route to other VPCs across network peerings along with [several other benefits](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/alias-ips).


In both `gcloud` and the Cloud Console, VPC-native is the default for new
clusters and many managed products such as CloudSQL, Memorystore and others
require VPC Native Clusters to work properly. In Terraform however, the default
behaviour is to create a routes-based cluster for backwards compatibility.

It's recommended that you create a VPC-native cluster, done by specifying the
`ipAllocationPolicy` block or using secondary ranges on existing subnet. Configuration will look like the following:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleComputeNetworkCustom = new google.computeNetwork.ComputeNetwork(
      this,
      "custom",
      {
        autoCreateSubnetworks: false,
        name: "test-network",
      }
    );
    const googleComputeSubnetworkCustom =
      new google.computeSubnetwork.ComputeSubnetwork(this, "custom_1", {
        ipCidrRange: "10.2.0.0/16",
        name: "test-subnetwork",
        network: cdktf.Token.asString(googleComputeNetworkCustom.id),
        region: "us-central1",
        secondaryIpRange: [
          {
            ipCidrRange: "192.168.1.0/24",
            rangeName: "services-range",
          },
          {
            ipCidrRange: "192.168.64.0/22",
            rangeName: "pod-ranges",
          },
        ],
      });
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    googleComputeSubnetworkCustom.overrideLogicalId("custom");
    new google.containerCluster.ContainerCluster(
      this,
      "my_vpc_native_cluster",
      {
        initialNodeCount: 1,
        ipAllocationPolicy: {
          clusterSecondaryRangeName: "pod-ranges",
          servicesSecondaryRangeName: cdktf.Token.asString(
            cdktf.propertyAccess(
              googleComputeSubnetworkCustom.secondaryIpRange,
              ["0", "range_name"]
            )
          ),
        },
        location: "us-central1",
        name: "my-vpc-native-cluster",
        network: cdktf.Token.asString(googleComputeNetworkCustom.id),
        subnetwork: cdktf.Token.asString(googleComputeSubnetworkCustom.id),
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Node Pool Management

In Terraform, we recommend managing your node pools using the
`googleContainerNodePool` resource, separate from the
`googleContainerCluster` resource. This separates cluster-level configuration
like networking and Kubernetes features from the configuration of your nodes.
Additionally, it helps ensure your cluster isn't inadvertently deleted.
Terraform struggles to handle complex changes to subresources, and may attempt
to delete a cluster based on changes to inline node pools.

However, the GKE API doesn't allow creating a cluster without nodes. It's common
for Terraform users to define a block such as the following:

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.containerCluster.ContainerCluster(this, "my-gke-cluster", {
      initialNodeCount: 1,
      location: "us-central1",
      name: "my-gke-cluster",
      removeDefaultNodePool: true,
    });
  }
}

```

This creates `initialNodeCount` nodes per zone the cluster has nodes in,
typically 1 zone if the cluster `location` is a zone, and 3 if it's a `region`.
Your cluster's initial GKE masters will be sized based on the
`initialNodeCount` provided. If subsequent node pools add a large number of
nodes to your cluster, GKE may cause a resizing event immediately after adding a
node pool.

The initial node pool will be created using the
[Compute Engine default service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account)
as the [`serviceAccount`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account).
If you've disabled that service account, or want to use a
[least privilege Google service account](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/hardening-your-cluster#use_least_privilege_sa)
for the temporary  node pool, you can add the following configuration to your
`googleContainerCluster` block:

```hcl
resource "google_container_cluster" "my-gke-cluster" {
  # other settings...

  node_config {
    service_account = "{{service_account}}"
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = ["node_config"]
  }

  # other settings...
}
```

### Windows Node Pools

You can add
[Windows Server node pools](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster-windows)
to your GKE cluster by adding `googleContainerNodePool` to your Terraform
configuration with `imageType=windowsLtsc` or `windowsSac`.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleContainerClusterDemoCluster =
      new google.containerCluster.ContainerCluster(this, "demo_cluster", {
        initialNodeCount: 1,
        ipAllocationPolicy: {
          clusterIpv4CidrBlock: "/14",
          servicesIpv4CidrBlock: "/20",
        },
        location: "us-west1-a",
        minMasterVersion: "1.16",
        name: "demo-cluster",
        project: "",
        removeDefaultNodePool: true,
      });
    const googleContainerNodePoolLinuxPool =
      new google.containerNodePool.ContainerNodePool(this, "linux_pool", {
        cluster: cdktf.Token.asString(googleContainerClusterDemoCluster.name),
        location: cdktf.Token.asString(
          googleContainerClusterDemoCluster.location
        ),
        name: "linux-pool",
        nodeConfig: {
          imageType: "COS_CONTAINERD",
        },
        project: cdktf.Token.asString(
          googleContainerClusterDemoCluster.project
        ),
      });
    new google.containerNodePool.ContainerNodePool(this, "windows_pool", {
      cluster: cdktf.Token.asString(googleContainerClusterDemoCluster.name),
      dependsOn: [googleContainerNodePoolLinuxPool],
      location: cdktf.Token.asString(
        googleContainerClusterDemoCluster.location
      ),
      name: "windows-pool",
      nodeConfig: {
        imageType: "WINDOWS_LTSC",
        machineType: "e2-standard-4",
      },
      project: cdktf.Token.asString(googleContainerClusterDemoCluster.project),
    });
  }
}

```

The example above creates a cluster with a small Linux node pool and a Windows
Server node pool. The Linux node pool is necessary since some critical pods are
not yet supported on Windows. Please see
[Limitations](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster-windows#limitations)
for details on features that are not supported by Windows Server node pools.
