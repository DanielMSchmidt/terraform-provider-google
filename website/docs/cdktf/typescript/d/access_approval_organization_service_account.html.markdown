# google\_access\_approval\_organization\_service\_account

Get the email address of an organization's Access Approval service account.

Each Google Cloud organization has a unique service account used by Access Approval.
When using Access Approval with a
[custom signing key](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-provider-access-management/access-approval/docs/review-approve-access-requests-custom-keys),
this account needs to be granted the `cloudkmsSignerVerifier` IAM role on the
Cloud KMS key used to sign approvals.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "google_access_approval_organization_service_account" "service_account" {
  organization_id = "my-organization"
}

resource "google_kms_crypto_key_iam_member" "iam" {
  crypto_key_id = google_kms_crypto_key.crypto_key.id
  role          = "roles/cloudkms.signerVerifier"
  member        = "serviceAccount:${data.google_access_approval_organization_service_account.service_account.account_email}"
}
```

## Attributes Reference
