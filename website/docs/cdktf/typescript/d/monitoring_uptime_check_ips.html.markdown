# google\_monitoring\_uptime\_check\_ips

Returns the list of IP addresses that checkers run from. For more information see
the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks#get-ips).

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataGoogleMonitoringUptimeCheckIpsIps =
      new google.dataGoogleMonitoringUptimeCheckIps.DataGoogleMonitoringUptimeCheckIps(
        this,
        "ips",
        {}
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "ip_list", {
      value: dataGoogleMonitoringUptimeCheckIpsIps.uptimeCheckIps,
    });
  }
}

```

## Attributes Reference

The following computed attributes are exported:

* `uptimeCheckIps` - A list of uptime check IPs used by Stackdriver Monitoring. Each `uptimeCheckIp` contains:
  * `region` - A broad region category in which the IP address is located.
  * `location` - A more specific location within the region that typically encodes a particular city/town/metro
  (and its containing state/province or country) within the broader umbrella region category.
  * `ipAddress` - The IP address from which the Uptime check originates. This is a fully specified IP address
  (not an IP address range). Most IP addresses, as of this publication, are in IPv4 format; however, one should not
  rely on the IP addresses being in IPv4 format indefinitely, and should support interpreting this field in either
  IPv4 or IPv6 format.
