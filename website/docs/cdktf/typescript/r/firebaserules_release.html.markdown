## Example Usage - storage_release
Creates a Firebase Rules Release for a Storage bucket
```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const googleStorageBucketBucket = new google.storageBucket.StorageBucket(
      this,
      "bucket",
      {
        location: "us-west1",
        name: "bucket",
        project: "my-project-name",

    );
    const googleFirebaseStorageBucketBucket = new google.FirebaseStorageBucket(

      "bucket_1",
      {
        bucket_id: googleStorageBucketBucket.name,
        project: "my-project-name",
        provider: googleBeta,
      }
    );
    /*This allows the Terraform resource name to match the original name. You can remove the call if you don't need them to match.*/
    googleFirebaseStorageBucketBucket.overrideLogicalId("bucket");
    const googleFirebaserulesRulesetStorage = new google.FirebaserulesRuleset(
      this,
      "storage",
      {
        dependsOn: [googleFirebaseStorageBucketBucket],
        project: "my-project-name",

      },
      name: "firebase.storage/${" + googleStorageBucketBucket.name + "}",
      project: "my-project-name",
      provider: googleBeta,
