Patch deployments are configurations that individual patch jobs use to complete a patch.
These configurations include instance filter, package repository settings, and a schedule.


To get more information about PatchDeployment, see:

  (Required)
  IANA Time Zone Database time zone, e.g. "America/New_York".

  (Optional)
  IANA Time Zone Database version number, e.g. "2019a".

<a name="nested_time_of_day"></a>The `timeOfDay` block supports:

* `hours` -
  (Optional)
  Hours of day in 24 hour format. Should be from 0 to 23.
  An API may choose to allow the value "24:00:00" for scenarios like business closing time.

* `minutes` -
  (Optional)
  Minutes of hour of day. Must be from 0 to 59.

* `seconds` -
  (Optional)
  Seconds of minutes of the time. Must normally be from 0 to 59. An API may allow the value 60 if it allows leap-seconds.

* `nanos` -
  (Optional)
  Fractions of seconds in nanoseconds. Must be from 0 to 999,999,999.

<a name="nested_weekly"></a>The `weekly` block supports:

* `dayOfWeek` -
  (Required)
  IANA Time Zone Database time zone, e.g. "America/New_York".
  Possible values are: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, `sunday`.

<a name="nested_monthly"></a>The `monthly` block supports:

* `weekDayOfMonth` -
  (Optional)
  Week day in a month.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_week_day_of_month).

* `monthDay` -
  (Optional)
  One day of the month. 1-31 indicates the 1st to the 31st day. -1 indicates the last day of the month.
  Months without the target day will be skipped. For example, a schedule to run "every month on the 31st"
  will not run in February, April, June, etc.


<a name="nested_week_day_of_month"></a>The `weekDayOfMonth` block supports:

* `weekOrdinal` -
  (Required)
  Week number in a month. 1-4 indicates the 1st to 4th week of the month. -1 indicates the last week of the month.

* `dayOfWeek` -
  (Required)
  A day of the week.
  Possible values are: `monday`, `tuesday`, `wednesday`, `thursday`, `friday`, `saturday`, `sunday`.

<a name="nested_rollout"></a>The `rollout` block supports:

* `mode` -
  (Required)
  Mode of the patch rollout.
  Possible values are: `zoneByZone`, `concurrentZones`.

* `disruptionBudget` -
  (Required)
  The maximum number (or percentage) of VMs per zone to disrupt at any given moment. The number of VMs calculated from multiplying the percentage by the total number of VMs in a zone is rounded up.
  During patching, a VM is considered disrupted from the time the agent is notified to begin until patching has completed. This disruption time includes the time to complete reboot and any post-patch steps.
  A VM contributes to the disruption budget if its patching operation fails either when applying the patches, running pre or post patch steps, or if it fails to respond with a success notification before timing out. VMs that are not running or do not have an active agent do not count toward this disruption budget.
  For zone-by-zone rollouts, if the disruption budget in a zone is exceeded, the patch job stops, because continuing to the next zone requires completion of the patch process in the previous zone.
  For example, if the disruption budget has a fixed value of 10, and 8 VMs fail to patch in the current zone, the patch job continues to patch 2 VMs at a time until the zone is completed. When that zone is completed successfully, patching begins with 10 VMs at a time in the next zone. If 10 VMs in the next zone fail to patch, the patch job stops.
  Structure is [documented below](#nested_disruption_budget).


<a name="nested_disruption_budget"></a>The `disruptionBudget` block supports:

* `fixed` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies a fixed value.

* `percentage` -
  (Optional)
  Specifies the relative value defined as a percentage, which will be multiplied by a reference value.
