# google\_kms\_crypto\_key

Provides access to a Google Cloud Platform KMS CryptoKey. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/object-hierarchy#key)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys).

A CryptoKey is an interface to key material which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. A CryptoKey belongs to a
Google Cloud KMS KeyRing.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataGoogleKmsKeyRingMyKeyRing =
      new google.dataGoogleKmsKeyRing.DataGoogleKmsKeyRing(
        this,
        "my_key_ring",
        {
          location: "us-central1",
          name: "my-key-ring",
        }
      );
    new google.dataGoogleKmsCryptoKey.DataGoogleKmsCryptoKey(
      this,
      "my_crypto_key",
      {
        keyRing: cdktf.Token.asString(dataGoogleKmsKeyRingMyKeyRing.id),
        name: "my-crypto-key",
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The CryptoKey's name.
    A CryptoKeyâ€™s name belonging to the specified Google Cloud Platform KeyRing and match the regular expression `[aZAZ09_-]{1,63}`

* `keyRing` - (Required) The `id` of the Google Cloud Platform KeyRing to which the key belongs.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `rotationPeriod` - Every time this period passes, generate a new CryptoKeyVersion and set it as
    the primary. The first rotation will take place after the specified period. The rotation period has the format
    of a decimal number with up to 9 fractional digits, followed by the letter s (seconds).

* `purpose` - Defines the cryptographic capabilities of the key.

* `id` - The identifier of the created CryptoKey. Its format is `projects/{projectId}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRingName}/cryptoKeys/{cryptoKeyName}`.
