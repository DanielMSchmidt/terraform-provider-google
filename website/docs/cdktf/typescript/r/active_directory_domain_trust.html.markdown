# google\_active\_directory\_domain\_trust

Adds a trust between Active Directory domains


To get more information about DomainTrust, see:

* [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.domains/attachTrust)
* How-to Guides
    * [Active Directory Trust](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/docs/create-one-way-trust)

~> **Warning:** All arguments including the following potentially sensitive
values will be stored in the raw state as plain text: `trustHandshakeSecret`.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage - Active Directory Domain Trust Basic


```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    new google.activeDirectoryDomainTrust.ActiveDirectoryDomainTrust(
      this,
      "ad-domain-trust",
      {
        domain: "test-managed-ad.com",
        targetDnsIpAddresses: ["10.1.0.100"],
        targetDomainName: "example-gcp.com",
        trustDirection: "OUTBOUND",
        trustHandshakeSecret: "Testing1!",
        trustType: "FOREST",
      }
    );
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:


* `targetDomainName` -
  (Required)
  The fully qualified target domain name which will be in trust with the current domain.

* `trustType` -
  (Required)
  The type of trust represented by the trust resource.
  Possible values are: `forest`, `external`.

* `trustDirection` -
  (Required)
  The trust direction, which decides if the current domain is trusted, trusting, or both.
  Possible values are: `inbound`, `outbound`, `bidirectional`.

* `targetDnsIpAddresses` -
  (Required)
  The target DNS server IP addresses which can resolve the remote domain involved in the trust.

* `trustHandshakeSecret` -
  (Required)
  The trust secret used for the handshake with the target domain. This will not be stored.
  **Note**: This property is sensitive and will not be displayed in the plan.

* `domain` -
  (Required)
  The fully qualified domain name. e.g. mydomain.myorganization.com, with the restrictions,
  https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.global.domains.

* `selectiveAuthentication` -
  (Optional)
  Whether the trusted side has forest/domain wide access or selective access to an approved set of resources.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs.
    If it is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference
