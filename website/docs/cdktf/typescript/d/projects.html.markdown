import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataGoogleProjectsMyOrgProjects =
      new google.dataGoogleProjects.DataGoogleProjects(
        this,
        "my-org-projects",
        {
          filter: "parent.id:012345678910 lifecycleState:DELETE_REQUESTED",
        }
      );
    new google.dataGoogleProject.DataGoogleProject(this, "deletion-candidate", {
      projectId: cdktf.Token.asString(
        cdktf.propertyAccess(dataGoogleProjectsMyOrgProjects.projects, [
          "0",
