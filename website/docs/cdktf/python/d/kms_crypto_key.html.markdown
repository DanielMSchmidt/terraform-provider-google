# google\_kms\_crypto\_key

Provides access to a Google Cloud Platform KMS CryptoKey. For more information see
[the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/object-hierarchy#key)
and
[API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings.cryptoKeys).

A CryptoKey is an interface to key material which can be used to encrypt and decrypt data. A CryptoKey belongs to a
Google Cloud KMS KeyRing.

## Example Usage

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        data_google_kms_key_ring_my_key_ring =
        google.data_google_kms_key_ring.DataGoogleKmsKeyRing(self, "my_key_ring",
            location="us-central1",
            name="my-key-ring"
        )
        google.data_google_kms_crypto_key.DataGoogleKmsCryptoKey(self, "my_crypto_key",
            key_ring=cdktf.Token.as_string(data_google_kms_key_ring_my_key_ring.id),
            name="my-crypto-key"
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The CryptoKey's name.
    A CryptoKeyâ€™s name belonging to the specified Google Cloud Platform KeyRing and match the regular expression `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,63}`

* `key_ring` - (Required) The `id` of the Google Cloud Platform KeyRing to which the key belongs.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `rotation_period` - Every time this period passes, generate a new CryptoKeyVersion and set it as
    the primary. The first rotation will take place after the specified period. The rotation period has the format
    of a decimal number with up to 9 fractional digits, followed by the letter s (seconds).

* `purpose` - Defines the cryptographic capabilities of the key.

* `id` - The identifier of the created CryptoKey. Its format is `projects/{projectId}/locations/{location}/keyRings/{keyRingName}/cryptoKeys/{cryptoKeyName}`.
