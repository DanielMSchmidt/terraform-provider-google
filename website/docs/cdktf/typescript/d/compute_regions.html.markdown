# google\_compute\_regions

Provides access to available Google Compute regions for a given project.
See more about [regions and zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) in the upstream docs.

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataGoogleComputeRegionsAvailable =
      new google.dataGoogleComputeRegions.DataGoogleComputeRegions(
        this,
        "available",
        {}
      );
    /*In most cases loops should be handled in the programming language context and 
    not inside of the Terraform context. If you are looping over something external, e.g. a variable or a file input
    you should consider using a for loop. If you are looping over something only known to Terraform, e.g. a result of a data source
    you need to keep this like it is.*/
    const googleComputeSubnetworkClusterCount = cdktf.TerraformCount.of(
      cdktf.Fn.lengthOf(dataGoogleComputeRegionsAvailable.names)
    );
    new google.computeSubnetwork.ComputeSubnetwork(this, "cluster", {
      ipCidrRange:
        "10.36.${" + googleComputeSubnetworkClusterCount.index + "}.0/24",
      name: "my-network",
      network: "my-network",
      region: cdktf.Token.asString(
        cdktf.propertyAccess(dataGoogleComputeRegionsAvailable.names, [
          googleComputeSubnetworkClusterCount.index,
        ])
      ),
      count: googleComputeSubnetworkClusterCount,
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `project` (Optional) - Project from which to list available regions. Defaults to project declared in the provider.
* `status` (Optional) - Allows to filter list of regions based on their current status. Status can be either `up` or `down`.
  Defaults to no filtering (all available regions - both `up` and `down`).

## Attributes Reference
