# google\_sql\_ssl\_cert

Creates a new Google SQL SSL Cert on a Google SQL Instance. For more information, see the [official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/), or the [JSON API](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/admin-api/v1beta4/sslCerts).

~> **Note:** All arguments including the private key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](https://www.terraform.io/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage

Example creating a SQL Client Certificate.

```python
import constructs as constructs
import cdktf as cdktf
# Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
import ...gen.providers.google as google
import ...gen.providers.random as random
class MyConvertedCode(cdktf.TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        # The following providers are missing schema information and might need manual adjustments to synthesize correctly: random.
        #     For a more precise conversion please use the --provider flag in convert.
        random_id_db_name_suffix = random.id.Id(self, "db_name_suffix",
            byte_length=4
        )
        google_sql_database_instance_main =
        google.sql_database_instance.SqlDatabaseInstance(self, "main",
            database_version="MYSQL_5_7",
            name="main-instance-${" + random_id_db_name_suffix.hex + "}",
            settings=SqlDatabaseInstanceSettings(
                tier="db-f1-micro"
            )
        )
        google.sql_ssl_cert.SqlSslCert(self, "client_cert",
            common_name="client-name",
            instance=cdktf.Token.as_string(google_sql_database_instance_main.name)
        )
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `instance` - (Required) The name of the Cloud SQL instance. Changing this
    forces a new resource to be created.

* `common_name` - (Required) The common name to be used in the certificate to identify the
    client. Constrained to [a-zA-Z.-_ ]+. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `project` - (Optional) The ID of the project in which the resource belongs. If it
    is not provided, the provider project is used.


## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are
exported:

* `sha1_fingerprint` - The SHA1 Fingerprint of the certificate.
* `private_key` - The private key associated with the client certificate.
* `server_ca_cert` - The CA cert of the server this client cert was generated from.
* `cert` - The actual certificate data for this client certificate.
* `cert_serial_number` - The serial number extracted from the certificate data.
* `create_time` - The time when the certificate was created in RFC 3339 format,
    for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.
* `expiration_time` - The time when the certificate expires in RFC 3339 format,
    for example 2012-11-15T16:19:00.094Z.

## Timeouts

This resource provides the following
[Timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/sdkv2/resources/retries-and-customizable-timeouts) configuration options: configuration options:

- `create` - Default is 10 minutes.
- `delete` - Default is 10 minutes.

## Import

Since the contents of the certificate cannot be accessed after its creation, this resource cannot be imported.
