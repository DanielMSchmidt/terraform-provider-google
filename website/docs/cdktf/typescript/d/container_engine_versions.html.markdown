# google\_container\_engine\_versions

Provides access to available Google Kubernetes Engine versions in a zone or region for a given project.

-> If you are using the `googleContainerEngineVersions` datasource with a
regional cluster, ensure that you have provided a region as the `location` to
the datasource. A region can have a different set of supported versions than
its component zones, and not all zones in a region are guaranteed to
support the same version.

## Example Usage

```typescript
import * as constructs from "constructs";
import * as cdktf from "cdktf";
/*Provider bindings are generated by running cdktf get.
See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.*/
import * as google from "./.gen/providers/google";
class MyConvertedCode extends cdktf.TerraformStack {
  constructor(scope: constructs.Construct, name: string) {
    super(scope, name);
    const dataGoogleContainerEngineVersionsCentral1B =
      new google.dataGoogleContainerEngineVersions.DataGoogleContainerEngineVersions(
        this,
        "central1b",
        {
          location: "us-central1-b",
          provider: googleBeta,
          versionPrefix: "1.12.",
        }
      );
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "stable_channel_default_version", {
      value: cdktf.propertyAccess(
        dataGoogleContainerEngineVersionsCentral1B.releaseChannelDefaultVersion,
        ['"STABLE"']
      ),
    });
    new cdktf.TerraformOutput(this, "stable_channel_latest_version", {
      value: cdktf.propertyAccess(
        dataGoogleContainerEngineVersionsCentral1B.releaseChannelLatestVersion,
        ['"STABLE"']
      ),
    });
    new google.containerCluster.ContainerCluster(this, "foo", {
      initialNodeCount: 1,
      location: "us-central1-b",
      name: "terraform-test-cluster",
      nodeVersion: cdktf.Token.asString(
        dataGoogleContainerEngineVersionsCentral1B.latestNodeVersion
      ),
    });
  }
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `location` (Optional) - The location (region or zone) to list versions for.
Must exactly match the location the cluster will be deployed in, or listed
versions may not be available. If `location`, `region`, and `zone` are not
specified, the provider-level zone must be set and is used instead.

* `project` (Optional) - ID of the project to list available cluster versions for. Should match the project the cluster will be deployed to.
  Defaults to the project that the provider is authenticated with.

* `versionPrefix` (Optional) - If provided, Terraform will only return versions
that match the string prefix. For example, `111` will match all `111` series
releases. Since this is just a string match, it's recommended that you append a
`.` after minor versions to ensure that prefixes such as `11` don't match
versions like `1125Gke10` accidentally. See [the docs on versioning schema](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/versioning-and-upgrades#versioning_scheme)
for full details on how version strings are formatted.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `validMasterVersions` - A list of versions available in the given zone for use with master instances.
* `validNodeVersions` - A list of versions available in the given zone for use with node instances.
* `latestMasterVersion` - The latest version available in the given zone for use with master instances.
* `latestNodeVersion` - The latest version available in the given zone for use with node instances.
* `defaultClusterVersion` - Version of Kubernetes the service deploys by default.
* `releaseChannelDefaultVersion` - A map from a release channel name to the channel's default version.
* `releaseChannelLatestVersion` - A map from a release channel name to the channel's latest version.
